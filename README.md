#Jumping Bird (Flappy Bird Remake)
I wanted to see if I could remake Flappy Bird and add some more flair to it.

#HOW TO PLAY:
- You'll need to download JDK (https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to run this project on your machine.

- For and IDE, I use IntelliJ, but feel free to use whatever IDE you prefer.

- Download the ZIP file, and unzip it somewhere on your machine where you'll remember.

- On your IDE, open the project that you just unzipped.

- Then run the application!
